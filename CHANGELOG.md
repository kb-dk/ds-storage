## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Fixed 

### Changed
- Moved storage method that is only used by unit tests to a storage subclass used by unittest. The methods are very destructive such as clearing all tables.

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/kb-dk/ds-storage/releases/tag/ds-storage-3.0.0) 2025-06-12
### Added
- Added endpoint /record/touch/{id} which allows touching of single records
- Integration unittest with OAuth access token. Require kb-util v.1.6.10 

### Fixed
- Fixed post record client method. Now it points at correct endpoint

### Changed
- touchRecord endpoint is now using a POST request instead of a GET request

## [2.3.3](https://github.com/kb-dk/ds-storage/releases/tag/ds-storage-2.3.3) 2025-03-05
## [Unreleased]
- Bumped SwaggerUI dependency to v5.18.2
- Bumped kb-util to v1.6.9 for service2service oauth support.
- Added injection of Oauth token on all service methods when using DsStorageClient.
- Removed auto generated DsStorageClient class that was a blocker for better exception handling. All DsStorageClient methods now only throws ServiceException mapped to HTTP status in same way calling the API directly.

### Added
- Property for database connection pool size. Under 'db' property new property: 'connectionPoolSize'. Reasonable values are from 10 to 100. 


### Fixed

- ID normalisation:
  If a record contains a invalid character after the recordbase part, it will be normalised and the invalid characters will be replaced.
  The original (invalid) id will be stored in the 'orgid' field and flagged for invalid id. Having the original id will make it possible
  to track it back to the collection it came from. The record can still be retrieved and updated using the invalid id, but also by the normalised id.
  Regexp for recordbase: ([a-z0-9.]+)       
  Regexp for id: ([a-z0-9.]+):([a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+)

- Jetty port set explicitly to 9072 instead of default 8080 to avoid collisions with projects using default tomcat/jetty setup.
