        This endpoint delivers a list of all configured origins. An origin defines which collection data comes from.
        This could for instance be the Radio & TV collection at The Royal Danish Library, which has the origin defined
        as 'ds.radiotv'. The update strategy defines how data from the specific origin is updated, when a record is
        added, modified or deleted.
